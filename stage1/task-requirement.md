# Color Guessing Game - Task Requirements

## Overview
Create an interactive color guessing game where players must identify the correct color from multiple options. The game should be built using React or VAnilla Javascript and include score tracking, feedback mechanisms, and a responsive design.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend Framework:** React
- **Styling:** CSS
- **Build Tool:** Create React App

## Component Requirements

### Color Display (`data-testid="colorBox"`)
- Display a box with a randomly selected color
- This will be the target color that players need to guess
- Should be prominently displayed and clearly visible

### Color Options (`data-testid="colorOption"`)
- Display 6 different color buttons
- Each button should have a unique background color

- Must be clickable and provide visual feedback on interaction

### Game Instructions (`data-testid="gameInstructions"`)
- Clear explanation of the game's objective
- Should be visible at all times
- Must be concise and easy to understand

### Game Status (`data-testid="gameStatus"`)
- Display feedback after each guess
- Show whether the guess was correct or incorrect
- Include appropriate visual feedback (colors, animations)

### Score Counter (`data-testid="score"`)
- Track and display the player's current score
- Increment score for correct guesses
- Persist score until game reset

### New Game Button (`data-testid="newGameButton"`)
- Allow players to start a new game at any time
- Reset the game state while preserving the score
- Clear visual styling to indicate its purpose

## Functional Requirements
